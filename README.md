## 🧰 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project is built using a modern technology stack that ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API, handling routing, models, and core backend logic.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that provides powerful tools and libraries for building and managing RESTful APIs with ease and flexibility.

- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as user information, property listings, and bookings.

- **GraphQL**: A query language that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data fetching.

- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used to handle background and asynchronous operations like sending notifications or processing payments.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching, task queuing with Celery, and session management to enhance performance.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments by packaging the application and its dependencies.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes, ensuring reliability and faster delivery.

## üß∞ Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project is built using a modern technology stack that ensures scalability, performance, and maintainability.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API, handling routing, models, and core backend logic.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: An extension of Django that provides powerful tools and libraries for building and managing RESTful APIs with ease and flexibility.

- **PostgreSQL**: A robust, open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as user information, property listings, and bookings.

- **GraphQL**: A query language that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data fetching.

- **Celery**: A distributed task queue used to handle background and asynchronous operations like sending notifications or processing payments.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching, task queuing with Celery, and session management to enhance performance.

- **Docker**: A containerization platform that ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments by packaging the application and its dependencies.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes, ensuring reliability and faster delivery.

## üß© Feature Breakdown

This Airbnb Clone project includes key features designed to simulate a full-scale property rental platform. Each feature plays a crucial role in delivering a smooth user experience and supporting platform operations.

### 1. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and profile management. Both guests and hosts can manage their accounts, update information, and perform role-specific actions.

### 2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, and delete rental properties. Hosts can provide property details, upload photos, and manage availability, enabling them to showcase accommodations to potential guests.

### 3. Booking System
Enables guests to search for properties, check availability, and make reservations. This system handles date selections, guest counts, and reservation status tracking.

### 4. Review and Rating System
Guests can leave feedback after their stay, providing star ratings and comments. Reviews help maintain trust on the platform and allow users to make informed decisions.

### 5. Payment Integration
Securely processes payments for bookings through supported payment gateways. This ensures smooth financial transactions between guests and hosts.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Allows users to search for properties based on location, price range, property type, and other criteria. This improves usability by helping users find listings that match their preferences.

### 7. Host Dashboard
Provides hosts with a personalized interface to manage listings, view booking requests, and track earnings. This feature improves host engagement and efficiency.

### 8. Notifications
Sends alerts and updates to users for events like booking confirmations, payment receipts, and review reminders. Helps keep users informed in real-time.

### 9. Admin Panel (Optional)
Includes a backend interface for site administrators to manage users, properties, and platform settings. Supports moderation and system-wide monitoring.

## üîê API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protecting sensitive user data, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining trust across the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented in the Airbnb Clone project:

### 1. Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of users through secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based tokens. Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints like booking, listing properties, or writing reviews.

**Why It Matters:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing personal data or performing sensitive actions.

---

### 2. Authorization
Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform. For example, only hosts should be able to manage their own properties, and only guests should be able to create bookings.

**Why It Matters:** Ensures that users can only interact with resources they own or have permission to access, preventing privilege escalation.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Limits the number of API requests a user or IP address can make in a given time frame. Tools like Django REST Framework‚Äôs throttling mechanisms will be used.

**Why It Matters:** Protects against brute-force attacks, DoS (Denial of Service), and abuse of API endpoints.

---

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
Validates all incoming data to avoid injection attacks (like SQL injection, XSS) and ensures that only clean, expected inputs are processed by the backend.

**Why It Matters:** Prevents malicious inputs from compromising the integrity or security of the application.

---

### 5. HTTPS/SSL Encryption
All API traffic will be encrypted using HTTPS to prevent data interception during transmission.

**Why It Matters:** Ensures secure communication between clients and the server, especially for sensitive data like passwords and payment information.

---

### 6. Secure Payment Handling
Integrate trusted third-party payment gateways (like Stripe or PayPal) to handle payment transactions securely and in compliance with industry standards.

**Why It Matters:** Prevents financial fraud and ensures PCI compliance for handling card data.

---

### 7. Token Expiry and Refresh
Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms for session security. Expired tokens will require users to re-authenticate.

**Why It Matters:** Reduces the risk of long-lived sessions being hijacked or reused by unauthorized users.

---

By incorporating these API security measures, the project ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and data.
